Have no fear 
For when I'm alone 
I'll be better off than I was before I've got this life 
I'll be around to grow 
Who I was before 
I cannot recall Long nights allow me to feel... 
I'm falling... I am falling 
The lights go out 
Let me feel 
I'm falling 
I am falling safely to the ground 
Ah... I'll take this soul that's inside me now 
Like a brand new friend 
I'll forever know I've got this light 
And the will to show 
I will always be better than before Long nights allow me to feel... 
I'm falling... I am falling 
The lights go out 
Let me feel 
I'm falling 
I am falling safely to the ground 
Ah...
