Last time I was sober, man I felt bad 
Worst hangover that I ever had 
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night 
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right 
'Cos if you wanna run cool 
If you wanna run cool 
If you wanna run cool, you got to run 
On heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel Yeah My life makes perfect sense 
Lust and food and violence 
Sex and money are my major kicks 
Get me in a fight I like the dirty tricks 
'Cos if you wanna run cool 
If you wanna run cool 
Yes if you wanna run cool, you got to run 
On heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel My chick loves a man who's strong 
The things she'll do to turn me on 
I love the babes, don't get me wrong 
Hey, that's why I wrote this song Yeah I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread 
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead 
When my ugly big car won't a-climb this hill 
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill 
'Cos if you wanna run cool 
If you wanna run cool 
Yes if you wanna run cool, you got to run 
On heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel Heavy, heavy fuel 
Heavy, heavy fuel Heavy, heavy fue-uel 
Heavy, heavy fue-uel Heavy, heavy fue-uel 
Heavy, heavy fue-uel Heavy, heavy fue-uel
