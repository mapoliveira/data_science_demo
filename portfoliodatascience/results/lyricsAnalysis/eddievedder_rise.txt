Such is the way of the world 
You can never know 
Just where to put all your faith 
And how will it grow Gonna rise up 
Burning black holes in dark memories 
Gonna rise up 
Turning mistakes into gold Such is the passage of time 
Too fast to fold 
And suddenly swallowed by signs 
Low and behold Gonna rise up 
Find my direction magnetically 
Gonna rise up 
Throw down my ace in the hole
