Baby I see this world has made you sad 
Some people can be bad 
The things they do, the thing they say 
But baby I'll wipe away those bitter tears 
I'll chase away those restless jears 
That turn your blue skies into grey Why worry, there should be laughter after pain 
There should be sunshine after rain 
These things has always been the same 
So why worry now Baby when I'm down I turn to you 
And you make sense of what I do 
I know it isn't hard to say 
Bat baby just when this world seems mean 
Our love comes shining red and gold and cold 
And all the rest is by the way Why worry, there should be laughter after pain 
There should be sunshine after rain 
There things has always been the some 
So why worry now. Bis
