More than you know 
More than you know 
Lately I find 
You're on my mind 
More than you know Whether I'm right 
Whether I'm wrong 
I need you so 
More than you know 
More than you know Loving you 
The way that I do 
There's nothing I can do about it 
And the little bit of love 
That I get may be all 
That you can give 
But I can't live without it Oh how I cry 
Oh how I cry If you got tired 
And said goodbye 
More than I'd show 
More than you'd ever, ever know 
More than you know More than you'd ever, ever know 
More than you know
