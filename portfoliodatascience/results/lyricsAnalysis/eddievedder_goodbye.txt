I ' ve got our love to remember 
That will never change 
I have you in my head 
And no I' ll never hold you 
And I' m still asking why 
I guess that this is goodbye m 
My I ' ve got our love to remember 
That will never change 
I have you in my head 
And no I' ll never hold you 
And I' m still asking why 
I guess that this is goodbye m 
My dreams suddenly seem so empty 
I could go on my own 
But I feel like playin dead 
And for what feels like the first time 
I don't know where you are tonight 
I guess that this is goodbye 
We lived half our lives together 
A hundred years is a lot of weight to bear 
An the sun, it maybe shining 
But there' s an ocean in my eyes 
' Cause I know that this is goodbye 
I know that this is goodbye
