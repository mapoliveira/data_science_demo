I didn't have to ask you, just took my hand 
Off we went skipping throughout the land 
The sky was blue and the blood filled my head 
Me and you skipping throughout the land 
All of my life from beginning to end 
What I remember is holding your hand 
And all that I'll cherish is that time that we've spent 
Me and you skipping throughout the land All the loves lost and the one that I found 
You lifted my gaze up off of the ground 
Forever we'll talk and forever we'll drown 
In each other skipping around Gravity pulls so many men down 
The atmosphere breathes but not in this town 
You took me away and you held me so proud 
Skipping, skipping, skipping around All the king's horses and all the king's men 
Could not keep me from holding your hand 
When all that I wanted was something to protect 
And all that I needed was your voice in my head 
And all I remember from this life that I lived 
Is me and you skipping throughout the land
